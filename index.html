                <h2>Hi! <br> I'm Ramyasree Chinta</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently I am pursuing my Master's in Industrial and Human
                    Factors Engineering at Wright State University and working on
                    research based on Advanced Air Mobility, leveraging AI for real-
                    time route optimization. I have a strong foundation in mechanical
                    engineering, complemented by extensive experience in design and
                    research. I have created innovative solutions, such as the Fully
                    Automated Robotic Kitchen, and improved manufacturing quality
                    and efficiency with my proficiency in GD&T, engineering
                    concepts, and various CAD tools. I bring a unique blend of
                    technical skills, problem-solving, and leadership, making me adept
                    at tackling complex engineering challenges.
