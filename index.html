<h2>Hi! <br/> I'm Ramyasree Chinta</h2>
<p>
                    A Mechanical Engineer with over 5 years of experience designing and industrializing electromechanical systems across the robotics, tooling, and automotive industries. My expertise spans CAD modeling, GD&T, injection molding, die design, and cross-functional collaboration with suppliers and manufacturing teams.
I enjoy solving engineering problems with a practical, hands-on approach, optimizing a mold for manufacturability or improving system reliability through better design. I’m especially passionate about contributing to sustainable, high-impact technologies that shape the future of mobility and automation.
